# Butangi Chatbot

This is a project that creates a chatbot basing on interactions of the Mangu' Alumni 2011 Class.

The goal of the chatbot will be for networking purposes basing on the individuals' occupations and similar interests.

It is built on top of the nltk library and published on streamlit

It is just a for-fun project and will be updated with more refined approach once I've laid out the basics of an AI Chatbot process.
